.SH DESCRIPTION

-- Classic Scopa

- Play game

Every player can play one card at a time: the first player is on the right of dealer; the other players come after, anticlockwise, until all cards are finished. At every hand, the dealer is replaced and the deck of card is passed to next player, always anticlockwise. 
First dealer is choosed as mutually agreed or by choosing at random among all players. Before start, the dealer asks for "cut" of the deck of card (entire deck is divided in two) to the player on his right.  

If the card in play has a value same as one or more cards on the table, the player can gather together these cards and hold them upside down as an own card deck; otherwise player must leave own card on the table.
If there are more combinations of cards which the player can gather by playing his card, the player is obliged to gather the card with the same value on the table. Every way, if there are more combinations composed by most cards, the player can choose the combination more advantageous. 

For instance:

* If there are a Three, a Five and a Knave (Fante in Italian) (value 8) on the table and if the player plays another Knave, then he must gather only the Knave on the table.

* If there are an Ace (Asso in Italian) (value 1), a Three, a Four and a Five, if the player plays an Knight (Cavallo in Italian) (value 9), then he can choose to gather together Ace+Three+Five (1+3+5) OR Four+Five (4+5) at h  is discretion.

When the hand terminates, latest player, that has successfully played a card, can gather all cards left on the table.

- How to do  Scopa

If a player gathers all cards on the table with a single move, then he scores 1 point and does Scopa! To mark a Scopa, the player puts one exposed card of those latest gathered on own deck of cards. Scopa is not valid if done with the latest move in a hand.

- Scoring

When the hand terminates, every player (or couple of players if it's a couples gaming) calculates own score:

* Scopa: every Scopa is valuated 1 point.

* Cards: the player (or couple of players) that has gathered most cards (at least 21 cards), he gets 1 point. If there is a draw, this point is not appointed.

* Coins (Denari in Italian): the player (or couple of players) that has gathered at least 6 cards of Coins (or at least 6 cards of Diamons), he gets 1 point. If there is a draw (5 cards each), this point is not appointed.

* Seven of Coins (Settebello in Italian) (or "Piricchio"): if a player takes the Seven of Coins (or the Seven of Diamonds), then he gets 1 point.

* Primiera: if a player (or couple of players) has a Primiera, he gets 1 point. The Primiera is major score obtained with 4 cards, for each suit, with following values:

  Card's value: 	       Value in the Primiera:      

 -Seven                    21
 -Six                      18
 -Ace                      16
 -Five                     15
 -Four                     14
 -Three                    13
 -Two                      12
 -King                     10
 -Knight                   10
 -Knave                    10
  

Every player sums all values of cards according to Primiera's rules; he who totalizes most high score, he wins the Primiera. It's need take at least one card for each suit otherwise the Primiera is not valid because it cannotbe calculated. If there is a draw (e.g if every couple of players takes 2 Seven and 2 Six of others two suits) or both Primiera are not valid, this point is not appointed.

- Winnings

All points taken in each hand are summed; the player (or couple of players) wins if he achieves or overtakes the 11 points. If several players (or couples of players) achieve or overtake the 11 points in the same hand, then he who has most high score, he wins. If there is a draw, the game continues until to the tie breaker. Every way, if an additional hand is initiated, it must be finished.



-- Beautiful King (Re Bello in Italian) 

The rules are the same of Classic Scopa, exept that the King of Coins (or of Diamonds) is valuated as the Seven of Coins (Settebello in Italian).
